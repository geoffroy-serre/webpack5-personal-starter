# webpack5-personal-starter
My starter for Webpack5 with babel, css and sass loader.

Start by installation:
```bash
npm install
```

All is live reloading if using
```bash
npm run start
```

To be seen, Html changes requires a manual browser refresh.

For a dev build use:
```bash
npm run dev
```
For a production build use
```bash
npm run build
```
